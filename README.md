# PhotoSorter
A simple program allowing to sort photos in a selected directory in the 'year/year.month.day' order
putting them to newly created directories accordingly.
The program can also sort videos accessing their exif info through the ExifTool utility (https://exiftool.org/) that must be put to the same folder as the program.
Files that could not be handled are put to the Unsorted directory.
The program has a simple GUI allowin to choose source and destination directory and see the log of the program's execution.
